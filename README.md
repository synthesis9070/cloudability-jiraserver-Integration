# cloudability-jiraserver-Integration

A personal project to automate the integration between Cloudability and on-premise Jira Server / DC.

Background: Cloudability has a native integration with Jira Cloud. Several of my large customers has on-prem Jira. While Atlassian will be sunsetting Jira on-prem in Feb 2024, many of the customers are large enough that they will be continuing beyond the EOL date. Consequentially, that sparks the interest & need to create a similar integration to support these customers.
